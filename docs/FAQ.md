# FAQ

## ❓️ Where do I put my files?

- You can place both scripts and libraries into the `minescript` folder. Any files inside of the system folder may get deleted upon updating the mod. Placing files outside of these folders will likely not allow them to run or be imported.

## ❓️ I have python but minescript isn't accessing it. Why?

- Error code 9009: You don't have python installed.
- Minescript's auto-python detection is not perfect, so it may grab the wrong python if you have multiple installed (or none at all!) make sure you know where the python instalation that you use is `where.exe python` (windows) and `which python` (Mac). **You may have to search for both python and python3!**
- Paste this path into your python path variable in config.txt.
- If all else fails, uninstalling and re-installing python is also an option. This will ensure that you have the most up-to-date python, which you can then put into your `config.txt` to use immediately.

## ❓️ Code won't run

- Commands should be typed with \, not /.

## ❓️ AI generated code doesn’t work 

- AIs such as ChatGPT have an extremely small set of data for Minescript and Pyjinn scripts, and thus are usually not fit to create them first-try.
- APIs generated by AI may not be accurate — always double-check whether the API you’re trying to use actually exists in the official documentation.

## ❓️ Can I use it on a server?

- Minescript is a client-side mod. This means that you can execute your scripts on any multiplayer server, but you cannot currently do anything server-side.

## ❓️ Can servers see that I'm using minescript?

- Minescript is a client-side mod. This means that servers are not given the fact that you have it installed, but may see some outputs.
- The `Chat()` and any function that executes a `/command` or messes with sending packets are sent to the server.
- Additionally, servers can see the way you move your character and interact with the world.
- Any other functions (ex: printing your position) aren't sent out

## ❓️ How can I enable autocomplete in VS Code?

- In VS Code, go to Settings (`Ctrl+,`) → `python.analysis.extraPaths` and add the Minescript library path (`minescript/system/lib`). This will enable minescript completion. You may need to set another path to your minescript folder to get user-made libraries to also complete.
- To make VS Code automatically format .pyj files in python, go to settings (`Ctrl+,`) → `files:associations` and add `**/*.pyj` with a value of `python`

## ❓️ What if the server version is old?

- Many modern servers allow backporting to older versions as long as your client is more recent than the server's actual version that it's running and in the same major update. (You can join a server running 1.21.4 on a 1.21.8 client, but likely not a 1.21.1 client.) For larger gaps in versions, consider using  **ViaVersion**, **ViaFabric**, or **ViaFabricPlus** to backport it.

## ❓️ How do I write an infinite loop in pyjinn?

- Pyjinn runs natively in the rendering thread of minecraft, meaning that your code cannot use a `while True` loop, as it would never give control back to the rest of the client. Instead, use `set_interval(func, ms)` for infinite loops.

## ❓️ How do I find what's in X Object / Variable?

- Print it. Printing an object will list it alongside any properties that you can call or read into chat.

## ❓️ My script seems to lag a lot after running it for a while, why is this?

- If you have lists, make sure that you are properly clearing them out to prevent a memory leak.

## ❓️ Why does X script/library only work on 1.21.5+ and vice versa?

- Mojang's APIs change from update to update, and so do minescript's. Particularly, rendering and internal mappings can become depricated, leading to community-made libraries only working before or after certain versions (1.21.5 being the most common).
- You can use ViaFabric to backport your client to an earlier version for servers if needed.
