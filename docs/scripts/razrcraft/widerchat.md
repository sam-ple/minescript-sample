# Wider Chat

A small utility to widen the chat window.

---

## 📌 Usage

```
\wider_chat <percentage>
```

- If no value is provided, the width defaults to **200%**.
- The setting persists across world changes and server disconnects.
- However, it **resets when Minecraft is closed**, as it isn't saved permanently yet.
